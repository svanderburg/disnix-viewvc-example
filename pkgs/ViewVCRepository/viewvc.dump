TO THE IMPATIENT
----------------
Congratulations on getting this far. :-)

  Required Software And Configuration Needed To Run ViewVC:

    For CVS Support: 

      * Python 1.5.2 or later
          (http://www.python.org/)
      * RCS, Revision Control System
          (http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/)
      * GNU-diff to replace diff implementations without the -u option
          (http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/diffutils.html)
      * read-only, physical access to a CVS repository
          (See http://www.cvshome.org/ for more information)

    For Subversion Support:

      * Python 2.0 or later
          (http://www.python.org/)
      * Subversion, Version Control System, 1.2.0 or later
          (binary installation and Python bindings)
          (http://subversion.tigris.org/)

    Optional:

      * a web server capable of running CGI programs
          (for example, Apache at http://httpd.apache.org/)
      * MySQL 3.22 and MySQLdb 0.9.0 or later to create a commit database
          (http://www.mysql.com/)
          (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)
      * Enscript, code colorizer
          (http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/)
      * Highlight, code colorizer, 2.2.10 or later required, 2.4.5 or
        later recommended for reliable line numbering
          (http://www.andre-simon.de/)
      * CvsGraph 1.5.0 or later, graphical CVS revision tree generator
          (http://www.akhphd.au.dk/~bertho/cvsgraph/)

  Quick sanity check:

    If you just want to see what your repository looks like when seen
    through ViewVC, type:

       $ bin/standalone.py -r /PATH/TO/REPOSITORY

    This will start a tiny ViewVC server at http://localhost:7467/viewvc/,
    to which you can connect with your browser.

  Standard operation:

    To start installing right away (on UNIX): type "./viewvc-install"
    in the current directory and answer the prompts.  When it
    finishes, edit the file viewvc.conf in the installation directory
    to tell ViewVC the paths to your CVS and Subversion repositories. 
    Next, configure your web server (in the way appropriate to that browser)
    to run <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi.  The section
    `INSTALLING VIEWVC' below is still recommended reading.


SECURITY INFORMATION
--------------------

ViewVC provides a feature which allows version controlled content to
be served to web browsers just like static web server content.  So, if
you have a directory full of interrelated HTML files that is housed in
your version control repository, ViewVC can serve those files as HTML.
You'll see in your web browser what you'd see if the files were part
of your website, with working references to stylesheets and images and
links to other pages.

It is important to realize, however, that as useful as that feature
is, there is some risk security-wise in its use.  Essentially, anyone
with commit access to the CVS or Subversion repositories served by
ViewVC has the ability to affect site content.  If a discontented or
ignorant user commits malicious HTML to a version controlled file
(perhaps just by way of documenting examples of such), that malicious
HTML is effectively published and live on your ViewVC instance.
Visitors viewing those versioned controlled documents get the
malicious code, too, which might not be what the original author
intended.

If you wish to disable ViewVC's "checkout" view which implements this
feature, you can do so by editing lib/viewvc.py, and modifying the
function view_checkout() like so, adding the lines indicated:

      def view_checkout(request):
>>      raise debug.ViewVCException('Checkout view is disabled',
>>                                  '403 Forbidden')
        path, rev = _orig_path(request)
        fp, revision = request.repos.openfile(path, rev)


INSTALLING VIEWVC
------------------

NOTE: Windows users can refer to windows/README for Windows-specific
installation instructions.

1) To get viewvc.cgi to work, make sure that you have Python installed
   and a webserver which is capable of executing CGI scripts (either
   based on the .cgi extension, or by placing the script within a specific
   directory).

   Note that to browse CVS repositories, the viewvc.cgi script needs to
   have READ-ONLY, physical access to the repository (or a copy of it).
   Therefore, rsh/ssh or pserver access to the repository will not work.
   And you need to have the RCS utilities installed, specifically "rlog",
   "rcsdiff", and "co".

2) Installation is handled by the ./viewvc-install script.  Run this
   script and you will be prompted for a installation root path.
   The default is /usr/local/viewvc-VERSION, where VERSION is
   the version of this ViewVC release.  The installer sets the install 
   path in some of the files, and ViewVC cannot be moved to a 
   different path after the install.

   Note: while 'root' is usually required to create /usr/local/viewvc,
   ViewVC does not have to be installed as root, nor does it run as root.
   It is just as valid to place ViewVC in a home directory, too.

   Note: viewvc-install will create directories if needed. It will
   prompt before overwriting files that may have been modified (such
   as viewvc.conf), thus making it safe to install over the top of
   a previous installation. It will always overwrite program files,
   however.

3) Edit <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/viewvc.conf for your specific 
   configuration.  In particular, examine the following configuration options:

      cvs_roots (for CVS)
      svn_roots (for Subversion)
      root_parents (for CVS or Subversion)
      default_root
      root_as_url_component
      rcs_path
      mime_types_file

   There are some other options that are usually nice to change. See
   viewvc.conf for more information.  ViewVC provides a working,
   default look. However, if you want to customize the look of ViewVC
   then edit the files in <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/templates.
   You need knowledge about HTML to edit the templates.

4) The CGI programs are in <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/.  You can 
   symlink to this directory from somewhere in your published HTTP server 
   path if your webserver is configured to follow symbolic links.  You can 
   also copy the installed <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/*.cgi 
   scripts after the install (unlike the other files in ViewVC, the scripts 
   under bin/ can be moved).

   If you are using Apache, then see below at the section titled
   APACHE CONFIGURATION.

   NOTE: for security reasons, it is not advisable to install ViewVC
   directly into your published HTTP directory tree (due to the MySQL
   passwords in viewvc.conf).

That's it for repository browsing.  Instructions for getting the SQL
checkin database working are below.


APACHE CONFIGURATION
--------------------

1) Find out where the web server configuration file is kept. Typical
   locations are /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf,
   and /etc/apache/httpd.conf. Depending on how apache was installed,
   you may also look under /usr/local/etc or /etc/local. Use the vendor
   documentation or the find utility if in doubt.

Either METHOD A: 
2) The ScriptAlias directive is very useful for pointing 
   directly to the viewvc.cgi script.  Simply insert a line containing

     ScriptAlias /viewvc <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi

   into your httpd.conf file.  Choose the location in httpd.conf where 
   also the other ScriptAlias lines reside.  Some examples:

     ScriptAlias /viewvc /usr/local/viewvc-1.0/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi
     ScriptAlias /query /usr/local/viewvc-1.0/bin/cgi/query.cgi

   continue with step 3).

or alternatively METHOD B: 
2) Copy the CGI scripts from 
   <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/*.cgi
   to the /cgi-bin/ directory configured in your httpd.conf file.

   continue with step 3).
   
and then there's METHOD C:
2) Copy the CGI scripts from 
   <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/cgi/*.cgi
   to the directory of your choosing in the Document Root adding the following
   apache directives for the directory in httpd.conf or an .htaccess file:

     Options +ExecCGI
     AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
     
   (Note: For this to work mod_cgi has to be loaded. And for the .htaccess file
   to be effective, "AllowOverride All" or "AllowOverride Options FileInfo"
   need to have been specified for the directory.)
   
   continue with step 3).

or if you've got Mod_Python installed you can use METHOD D:
2) Copy the Python scripts and .htaccess file from 
   <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/mod_python/
   to a directory being served by apache.
   
   In httpd.conf, make sure that "AllowOverride All" or at least 
   "AllowOverride FileInfo Options" are enabled for the directory
   you copied the files to.
   
   Note: If you are using Mod_Python under Apache 1.3 the tarball generation
   and enscript colorizing features may not work because they use
   multithreading. They do work fine with Apache 2.
   
   continue with step 3).

3) Restart apache.  The commands to do this vary.  "httpd -k restart" and 
   "apache -k restart" are two common variants.  On RedHat Linux it is
   done using the command "/sbin/service httpd restart" and on SuSE Linux
   it is done with "rcapache restart" 

4) Optional: Add access control.

   In your httpd.conf you can control access to certain modules by adding 
   directives like this:

      <Location "<url to viewvc.cgi>/<modname_you_wish_to_access_ctl>">
        AllowOverride None
        AuthUserFile /path/to/passwd/file
        AuthName "Client Access"
        AuthType Basic
        require valid-user
      </Location>

   WARNING: If you enable the "checkout_magic" or "allow_tar" options, you
   will need to add additional location directives to prevent people
   from sneaking in with URLs like:

      http://<server_name>/viewvc/*checkout*/<module_name>
      http://<server_name>/viewvc/~checkout~/<module_name>
      http://<server_name>/viewvc/<module_name>.tar.gz?view=tar

5) Optional: Protect your ViewVC instance from server-whacking webcrawlers.

   As ViewVC is a web-based application which each page containing various
   links to other pages and views, you can expect your server's performance
   to suffer if a webcrawler finds your ViewVC instance and begins

UPGRADING VIEWVC
-----------------

Please read the file upgrading-howto.html in the docs/ subdirectory.


SQL CHECKIN DATABASE
--------------------

This feature is a clone of the Mozilla Project's Bonsai database.  It
catalogs every commit in the CVS or Subversion repository into a SQL
database.  In fact, the databases are 100% compatible.

Various queries can be performed on the database.  After installing ViewVC,
there are some additional steps required to get the database working.

1) You need MySQL and MySQLdb (a Python DBAPI 2.0 module) installed.

2) You need to create a MySQL user who has permission to create databases.
   Optionally, you can create a second user with read-only access to the
   database.

3) Run the <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/make-database script.  It will 
   prompt you for your MySQL user, password, and the name of database you 
   want to create.  The database name defaults to "ViewVC".  This script 
   creates the database and sets up the empty tables.  If you run this on a 
   existing ViewVC database, you will lose all your data!

4) Edit your <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/viewvc.conf file.  
   There is a [cvsdb] section.  You will need to set:
     
      enabled = 1        # Whether to enable query support in viewvc.cgi
      host =             # MySQL database server host
      port =             # MySQL database server port (default is 3306)
      database_name =    # name of database you created with make-database
      user =             # read/write database user
      passwd =           # password for read/write database user
      readonly_user =    # read-only database user
      readonly_passwd =  # password for the read-only user

   Note that it's pretty safe in this instance for your read-only user
   and your read-write user to be the same.

5) At this point, you need to tell your version control system(s) to 
   publish their commit information to the database.  This is done
   using utilities that ViewVC provides.

   To publish CVS commits into the database:

      Two programs are provided for updating the checkin database from
      a CVS repository, cvsdbadmin and loginfo-handler.  They serve
      two different purposes.  The cvsdbadmin program walks through
      your CVS repository and adds every commit in every file.  This
      is commonly used for initializing the database from a repository
      which has been in use.  The loginfo-handler script is executed
      by the CVS server's CVSROOT/loginfo system upon each commit.  It
      makes real-time updates to the checkin database as commits are
      made to the repository.

      To build a database of all the commits in the CVS repository
      /home/cvs, invoke: "./cvsdbadmin rebuild /home/cvs".  If you
      want to update the checkin database, invoke: "./cvsdbadmin
      update /home/cvs".  The update mode checks to see if a commit is
      already in the database, and only adds it if it is absent.

      To get real-time updates, you'll want to checkout the CVSROOT
      module from your CVS repository and edit CVSROOT/loginfo.  For
      folks running CVS 1.12 or better, add this line:

         ALL <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/loginfo-handler %p %{sVv}

      If you are running CVS 1.11 or earlier, you'll want a slightly
      different command line in CVSROOT/loginfo:

        ALL <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/loginfo-handler %{sVv}
   
      If you have other scripts invoked by CVSROOT/loginfo, you will
      want to make sure to change any running under the "DEFAULT"
      keyword to "ALL" like the loginfo handler, and probably
      carefully read the execution rules for CVSROOT/loginfo from the
      CVS manual.
   
      If you are running the Unix port of CVS-NT, the handler script
      need to know about it.  CVS-NT delivers commit information to
      loginfo scripts differently than the way mainstream CVS does.
      Your command line should look like this:
      
        ALL <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/loginfo-handler %{sVv} cvsnt

   To publish Subversion commits into the database:

      To build a database of all the commits in the Subversion
      repository /home/svn, invoke: "./svndbadmin rebuild /home/svn".
      If you want to update the checkin database, invoke:
      "./svndbadmin update /home/svn".

      To get real time updates, you will need to add a post-commit
      hook (for the repository example above, the script should go in
      /home/svn/hooks/post-commit).  The script should look something
      like this:

         #!/bin/sh
         REPOS="$1"
         REV="$2"
         <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin/svndbadmin rebuild "$REPOS" "$REV"

      If you allow revision property changes in your repository,
      create a post-revprop-change hook script containing the same
      commands as the post-commit one.  This will make sure that the
      checkin database stays consistent when you change the svn:log,
      svn:author or svn:date revision properties.

You should be ready to go.  Click one of the "Query revision history"
links in ViewVC directory listings and give it a try.


ENABLING SYNTAX COLORATION
--------------------------

Enscript and Highlight are two programs that can colorize source code
for a lot of languages.  ViewVC can be configured to use either one.

1) Install Enscript or Highlight using your system's package manager
   or downloading from the project home pages.

2) Set either the 'use_enscript' or 'use_highlight' options in
   viewvc.conf to 1.

3) You may also need to set 'enscript_path' or 'highlight_path' option
   if the executables are not located on the system PATH.

That's it!  Now when you view the contents of recognized filetypes in
ViewVC, you should see colorized syntax.


CVSGRAPH CONFIGURATION
----------------------

CvsGraph is a program that can display a clickable, graphical tree
of files in a CVS repository.

WARNING: Under certain circumstances (many revisions of a file
or many branches or both) CvsGraph can generate very huge images.
Especially on thin clients these images may crash the Web-Browser.
Currently there is no known way to avoid this behavior of CvsGraph.
So you have been warned!  

Nevertheless, CvsGraph can be quite helpful on repositories with 
a reasonable number of revisions and branches.

1) Install CvsGraph using your system's package manager or downloading
   from the project home page.

2) Set the 'use_cvsgraph' options in viewvc.conf to 1.

3) You may also need to set the 'cvsgraph_path' option if the 
   CvsGraph executable is not located on the system PATH.

4) There is a file <VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/cvsgraph.conf that
   you may want to edit if desired to set color and font characteristics.
   See the cvsgraph.conf documentation.  No edits are required in
   cvsgraph.conf for operation with ViewVC.


SUBVERSION INTEGRATION
----------------------

Unlike the CVS integration, which simply wraps the RCS and CVS utility
programs, the Subversion integration requires additional Python
libraries.  To use ViewVC with Subversion, make sure you have both
Subversion itself and the Subversion Python bindings installed.  See
Subversion's installation notes for more details on how to build and
install these items.

Generally speaking, you'll know when your installation of Subversion's
bindings has been successful if you can import the 'svn.core' module
from within your Python interpreter.  Here's an example of doing so
which doubles as a quick way to check what version of the Subversion
Python binding you have:

   % python
   Python 2.2.2 (#1, Oct 29 2002, 02:47:30) 
   [GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.2 2.96-108.7.2)] on linux2
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> from svn.core import *
   >>> "%s.%s.%s" % (SVN_VER_MAJOR, SVN_VER_MINOR, SVN_VER_PATCH)
   '1.2.0'
   >>>

Note that by default, Subversion installs its bindings in a location
that is not in Python's default module search path (for example, on
Linux systems the default is usually /usr/local/lib/svn-python).  You
need to remedy this, either by adding this path to Python's module
search path, or by relocating the bindings to some place in that
search path.

For example, you might want to create .pth file in your Python
installation directory's site-packages area which tells Python where
to find additional modules (in this case, you Subversion Python
bindings).  You would do this as follows (and as root):

   $ echo "/path/to/svn/bindings" > /path/to/python/site-packages/svn.pth

(Though, obviously, with the correct paths specified.)

Configuration of the Subversion repositories happens in much the same
way as with CVS repositories, only with the 'svn_roots' configuration
variable instead of the 'cvs_roots' one.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ...
------------------------

If nothing seems to work:

  * Check if you can execute CGI-scripts (Apache needs to have an
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin or cgi-script Handler defined). Try to
    execute a simple CGI-script that often comes with the distribution
    of the webserver; locate the logfiles and try to find hints which
    explain the malfunction

  * View the entries in the webserver's error.log
 
If ViewVC seems to work but doesn't show the expected result (Typical
error: you can't see any files)

  * Check whether the CGI-script has read-permissions to your
    CVS-Repository. The CGI-script generally runs as the same user
    that the web server does, often user 'nobody' or 'httpd'.

  * Does ViewVC find your RCS utilities? (edit rcs_path)

If something else happens or you can't get it to work:

  * Check the ViewVC home page:

       http://viewvc.org/

  * Review the ViewVC mailing list archive to see if somebody else had
    the same problem, and it was solved:

       http://viewvc.tigris.org/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=users

  * Check the ViewVC issue database to see if the problem you are
    seeing is the result of a known bug:

       http://viewvc.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi
 
  * Send mail to the ViewVC mailing list, users@viewvc.tigris.org.
    NOTE: make sure you provide an accurate description of the problem
    -- including the version of ViewVC you are using -- and any
    relevant tracebacks or error logs.

PREFACE
-------
This file will go away soon after release 0.8.  Please use the SourceForge 
tracker to resubmit any of the items listed below, if you think, it is 
still an issue:  
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=18760
Before reporting please check, whether someone else has already done this.
Working patches increase the chance to be included into the next release.
                                                     -- PeFu / October 2001

TODO ITEMS
----------
*) add Tamminen Eero's comments on how to make Linux directly execute
   the Python script. From email on Feb 19.
   [ add other examples, such as my /bin/sh hack or the teeny CGI stub 
     importing the bulk hack ]

*) insert rcs_path into PATH before calling "rcsdiff". rcsdiff might
   use "co" and needs to find it on the path.

*) show the "locked" flag (attach it to the LogEntry objects).
   Idea from Russell Gordon <russell@hoopscotch.dhs.org>

*) committing with a specific revision number:
   http://mailman.lyra.org/pipermail/viewcvs/2000q1/000008.html

*) add capability similar to cvs2cl.pl:
     http://mailman.lyra.org/pipermail/viewcvs/2000q2/000050.html
   suggestion from Chris Meyer <cmeyer@gatan.com>.

*) add a tree view of the directory structure (and files?)

*) include a ConfigParser.py to help older Python installations

*) add a check for the rcs programs/paths to viewvc-install. clarify the
   dependency on RCS in the docs.

*) have a "check" mode that verifies binaries are available on rcs_path

   -> alternately (probably?): use rcsparse rather than external tools

KNOWN BUGS
----------
*) time.timezone seems to not be available on some 1.5.2 installs.
   I was unable to verify this.  On RedHat and SuSE Linux this bug
   is non existant.

*) With old repositories containing many branches, tags or thousands
   or revisions, the cvsgraph feature becomes unusable (see INSTALL).
   ViewVC can't do much about this, but it might be possible to
   investigate the number of branches, tags and revision in advance
   and disable the cvsgraph links, if the numbers exceed a certain
   treshold.

#
# To add all the checkins from a Subversion repository to the checkin

#    /path/to/svndbadmin rebuild /path/to/repo
#

# If you allow changes to revision properties in your repository, you

#   and hex escapes. Note that '\' must be escaped
#   if it is to be entered as a character.
#
# - Some strings are expanded with printf like
#   conversions which start with '%'. Not all
#   are applicable at all times, in which case they
#   will expand to nothing.

# - The merge_from is an extended regular expression as described in

# - The merge_to is an extended regular expression with a twist. All

#   using %[1-9] (in contrast to \[1-9] for backreferences). Care is
#   taken to escape the constructed expression.
# - A '$' at the end of the merge_to expression can be important to
#   prevent 'near match' references. Normally, you want the destination
#   to be a good representation of the source. However, this depends
#   on how well you defined the tags in the first place.
#
# Example:
#	merge_from = "^f_(.*)";
#	merge_to = "^t_%1$";

#		f_foo	-> "^t_foo$"	-> t_foo

<h2 id="sec-upgrading">Upgrading Basics</h2>

<p>This document describes some of the things that you will need to 
   consider, change, or handle when upgrading an existing ViewVC
   or ViewCVS installation to a newer version.</p>

<p>Upgrading from an ancient version to the latest version
   isn't necessarily a multi step process.  The instructions are only
   organized that way.  You can certainly upgrade in a single step.</p>

<p>It is always recommended to install the new version in a fresh
   directory and to carefully compare the configuration files.  A
   possible approach is to name the directories
   <code>/usr/local/viewvc-1.0</code>,
   <code>/usr/local/viewcvs-1.1</code> and so on and than create a
   symbolic link <code>viewvc</code> pointing to the production
   version.  This way you can easily test several versions and switch
   back if your users start to complain.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<h2 id="sec-from-0-9">Upgrading From ViewCVS 0.9</h2>

<p>This section discusses how to upgrade ViewCVS 0.9 to ViewVC 1.0.</p>

<h3>CGI Stubs</h3>
    
<p>The CGI stub scripts haved been moved from
   <code>&lt;VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY&gt;/cgi/</code> to
   <code>&lt;VIEWVC_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY&gt;/bin/cgi/</code>, so
   you will need update any ScriptAlias directives pointing to them in
   your apache configuration. Also, the contents of these scripts have
   changed, so you may need to replace copies of the old scripts you
   put in other directories.</p>

<h3>Checkin Database</h3>
    
<p>ViewVC 1.0 reads and writes commit times in the MySQL database in
   UTC time rather than local time. This can cause times displayed on
   the query page to be a few hours off if an old database is being
   used with a new version of ViewVC.  The best way to fix this is to
   rebuild the database with the new version of cvsdbadmin, but it
   is also possible to enable a backwards compatibility mode by
   setting <code>utc_time = 0</code> at the top of lib/dbi.py</p>

<h3>"checkout_magic" Option</h3>

<p>In ViewVC 1.0, the <code>checkout_magic</code> option has been
   disabled by default to provide a simpler URL scheme that works
   safely with URL authorization. Most users will not notice any
   difference in behavior, but users who had been using ViewCVS to
   browse the contents of static HTML pages stored in a repository
   may notice that links and images in those pages targetted at other
   files in the repository no longer display correctly. The new
   <code>default_file_view</code> option can be used to solve this
   problem and, if neccessary, <code>checkout_magic</code> can also
   be re-enabled. The <code>viewcvs.conf</code> file describes these
   options in detail.</p>

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

<p>The following options have been added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general/svn_roots</li>
  <li>general/root_parents</li>
  <li>general/use_rcsparse</li>
  <li>general/cvsnt_exe_path</li>
  <li>options/template_dir</li>
  <li>options/docroot</li>
  <li>options/http_expiration_time</li>
  <li>options/generate_etags</li>
  <li>options/root_as_url_component</li>
  <li>options/default_file_view</li>
  <li>options/sort_group_dirs</li>
  <li>options/use_pagesize</li>
  <li>options/limit_changes</li>
  <li>options/use_localtime</li>
  <li>options/cross_copies</li>
  <li>options/use_highlight</li>
  <li>options/highlight_path</li>
  <li>options/highlight_line_numbers</li>
  <li>options/highlight_convert_tabs</li>
  <li>options/use_php</li>
  <li>options/php_path</li>
  <li>options/svn_path</li>
  <li>templates/error</li>
  <li>templates/query_form</li>
  <li>templates/query_results</li>
  <li>cvsdb/port</li>
  <li>cvsdb/rss_row_limit</li>
</ul>

<p>The following options have been removed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general/main_title</li>
  <li>options/diff_font_face</li> 
  <li>options/diff_font_size</li>
  <li>options/disable_enscript_lang</li>
  <li>templates/footer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Templates</h3>
    
<p>The templates have changed drastically in this version of ViewVC.
   If you are using customized templates from 0.9 or earlier, you will want
   to port your old customizations to the new template files instead of
   trying to get the old template files to work with the new ViewVC.</p>

<p>There is a new <a href="template-authoring-guide.html">Template
   Authoring Guide</a> for ViewVC 1.0 templates that can help you
   with your customizations. And the chart below lists all 0.9 
   template variables and shows what's become of them in 1.0.</p>

<h4>Template Arrangement</h4>
    
<p>The default templates have been rearranged a bit in ViewVC 1.0.
   Specifically, "header.ezt" and "footer.ezt" have moved into the
   "templates/include/" subdirectory.  Also, "directory.ezt" and
   "dir_alternate.ezt" now reference new template files
   "dir_header.ezt" and "dir_footer.ezt", also found in the
   "templates/include/" subdirectory.</p>

<p>Notably, the "markup.ezt" and "annotate.ezt" templates are now
   fully self-contained.  That is, the markup and annotation data
   generated by ViewVC is now accessible in those templates just like
   other template variables.  As a result, ViewVC now has no more
   internal need for the <var>templates.footer</var> configuration
   variable, so that variable has been removed from the default

<h2 id="sec-from-0-8">Upgrading From ViewCVS 0.8</h2>

    <p>
      This section discusses how to upgrade ViewCVS 0.8 to version
      0.9 or a later version of the software.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> these changes will bring you up to the
      requirements of version 0.9. You must also follow the directions
      for <a href="#from9">upgrading from 0.9</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration Options</h3>
    <p>
      More templates were introduced in version 0.8 of the software,
      which made many of the configuration options obsolete. This
      section covers which options were removed. If you made any
      changes to these options, then you will need to make
      corresponding changes in the templates.
    </p>

      <dl>
	<dt>
	  Colors:
	  <strong>diff_heading</strong>,
	  <strong>diff_empty</strong>,
	  <strong>diff_remove</strong>,
	  <strong>diff_change</strong>,
	  <strong>diff_add</strong>,
	  and <strong>diff_dark_change</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  These options have been incorporated into the
	  <code>diff.ezt</code> template.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>markup_log</strong></dt>
	<dd>
	  This option has been incorporated into the
	  <code>markup.ezt</code> template.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

        <dt>Colors: <strong>nav_header</strong>
          and <strong>alt_background</strong></dt>
	<dd>
	  These options have been incorporated into the
	  <code>header.ezt</code> template.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

        <dt>
	  Images:
          <strong>back_icon</strong>,
          <strong>dir_icon</strong>,
          and <strong>file_icon</strong>
        </dt>
	<dd>
	  These options have been incorporated into the
	  <code>directory.ezt</code>, <code>header.ezt</code>,
	  <code>log.ezt</code>, <code>log_table.ezt</code>, and
	  <code>query.ezt</code> templates.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>use_java_script</strong>
          and <strong>open_extern_window</strong></dt>
	<dd>
	  The templates now use JavaScript in all applicable places,
	  and open external windows for most downloading and viewing
	  of files. If you wish to not use JavaScript and/or external
	  windows, then remove the feature(s) from the templates.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>show_author</strong></dt>
	<dd>
          Changing this option would be quite strange and rare. If you
          do not want to show the author for the revisions, then you
          should remove it from the various templates.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>hide_non_readable</strong></dt>
	<dd>
          This option was never used, so it has been removed.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>flip_links_in_dirview</strong></dt>
	<dd>
          This option is no longer available. If you want the links in
          your directory view flipped, then you may use the
          <code>dir_alternate.ezt</code> template.

	  <p></p>
	</dd>

      </dl>

    <h3>Template Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Some template variables that were available in 0.8 have been
      removed in 0.9. If you have custom templates that refer to these
      variables, then you will need to modify your templates.
    </p>

	    <dl>
	      <dt><code>directory.ezt</code>: <var>headers</var></dt>
	      <dd>
		The headers are now listed explicitly in the template,
		rather than made available through a list.
		<p></p>
	      </dd>

	      <dt>
		<code>directory.ezt</code>:
		<var>rows.cols</var>,
		and <var>rows.span</var>
	      </dt>
	      <dd>
		These variables were used in conjunction with the
		<var>headers</var> variable to control the column
		displays. This is now controlled explicitly within the
		templates.
		<p></p>
	      </dd>

	      <dt><code>directory.ezt</code>:
		<var>rev_in_front</var></dt>
	      <dd>
		This was used to indicate that revision links should
		be used in the first column, rather than in their
		standard place in the second column. Changing the
		links should now be done in the template, rather than
		according to this variable. You may want to look at
		the <code>dir_alternate.ezt</code> template, which has
		the revision in front.
		<p></p>
	      </dd>

	      <dt><code>directory.ezt</code>:
		<var>rows.attic</var>
		and <var>rows.hide_attic_href</var></dt>
	      <dd>
		These variable were used to manage the hide and
		showing of the contents of the <code>Attic/</code>
		subdirectory. Several new variables were introduced
		which can be used to replace this functionality:
		<var>show_attic_href</var>,
		<var>hide_attic_href</var>, and <var>rows.state</var>.
		<p></p>
	      </dd>
	    </dl>

<h1>ViewVC 1.0 URL Reference</h1>

<div class="h2">
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the format of URLs accepted by ViewVC 1.0 and is intended to be useful to users and outside software developers who want to create links to ViewVC pages. It should also be useful to ViewVC developers as a way of tracking and documenting the many quirks of ViewVC's URL handling logic.</p>

<p>Future releases of ViewVC will support the URL formats described in this document. Certain URLs currently accepted by ViewVC, such as redirecting URLs that result from the submission of form elements on ViewVC pages, are not documented here and therefore may not be supported by future releases of ViewVC.</p>

<h2 id="components">URL Components</h2>
<p>A ViewVC URL consists of 3 components: a <a href="#script-component">Script Location</a>, a <a href="#path-component">Repository Path</a>, and some optional <a href="#query-component">Query Parameters</a>. Some examples:</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>ViewVC Script Location</th>
  <th>Repository Path</th>
  <th>Query Parameters</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>http://example.org/viewvc.cgi</code></td>
  <td><code>/some/file</code></td>
  <td><code>?view=log&amp;revision=1.34</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>http://example.org/viewvc.cgi</code></td>
  <td><code>/*checkout*/some/other/file</code></td>
  <td><code>?revision=1.10.2.5</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>http://example.org/viewvc.cgi</code></td>
  <td><code>/some/dir/</code></td>
  <td><code>?pathrev=BRANCH_2_3</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>http://example.org/viewvc.cgi</code></td>
  <td><code>/some/dir.tar.gz</code></td>
  <td><code>?view=tar&amp;pathrev=BRANCH_2_3</code></td>

<tr>
  <td><code>http://example.org/viewvc.cgi</code></td>
  <td><code>/yet/another/file</code></td>
  <td><code>?view=diff?r1=1.12&amp;r2=1.14</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 id="script-component">ViewVC Script Location</h3>
<p>The script location is a common base for all ViewVC URL's pertaining to a particular installation. It's whatever location the web server is configured to serve ViewVC pages from.</p>

<h3 id="path-component">Repository Path</h3>
<p>Since ViewVC is essentially a file system browser for repositories, repository paths referring to the files and directories being browsed get their own section in ViewVC URLs immediately following the script location. Repository paths are always case sensitive and separated by forward slashes, regardless of the underlying filesystem.</p>

<p>Repository paths can be given certain "magic" prefixes and suffixes. For example, a "/*checkout*" prefix can be added to file views to force a checkout even without an explicit "view=co" query parameter. And a ".tar.gz" suffix is added to download tarball URLs so downloaded tarballs will be saved with sensible default names.</p>

<p>If the <code>root_as_url_component</code> configuration option is enabled, the first directory name in a repository path (after any magic prefix) is taken to be the name (from the ViewVC configuration) of the repository to browse rather than the name of an actual directory. The repository name can also be specified in a "root=" query parameter instead (see <a href="#root-param"><code>root</code> parameter</a> below).</p>

<p>Paths beginning with "/*docroot*/" are an exception the rules above. These paths are used to provide access to files in the ViewVC template directory: image files, static HTML pages, and the ViewVC stylesheet. For more information, see the <a href="#docroot-view">Docroot View</a> syntax below.</p>

<h3 id="query-component">Query Parameters</h3>

<p>Following the ViewVC and repository locations in URLs is an optional query string, a list of parameter/value pairs written like "?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2..." Some parameters, like "revision", "pathrev", and "root", augment repository path information, specifying revisions and repositories. Other parameters like "logsort" and "diff_format" control ViewVC display options. Some parameters are also "sticky" and get embedded into links inside the generated pages, sticking around for future page views.</p>

<p>ViewVC provides a number of different views of repository data including a directory listing view, a log view, a file diff view, and others. (The views are listed and described in the <code>help_rootview.html</code> ViewVC help page). URLs for each of these views accept specific parameters described in the <a href="#syntax">URL Syntax</a> section, but some parameters are used by multiple views and they are described below:</p>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td id="view-param"><code>view</code></td>
    <td>The name of the view to display, does not need to be explicitly specified in many URLs. Possible values are shown in the <a href="#url-syntax">URL Syntax</a> section below.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="revision-param"><code>revision</code></td>
    <td>The revision or tag to display information about, used by several different views.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="pathrev-param"><code>pathrev</code></td>
    <td>The current sticky revision (Subversion) or sticky tag (CVS), as described in the <code>help_rootview.html</code> ViewVC help page. In Subversion, because path information is revision controlled, this value is also used to look up paths in the repository, providing a means of accessing paths that no longer exist in HEAD.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="root-param"><code>root</code></td>
    <td>The name of the repository to browse. When the <code>default_root</code> configuration option is set or the <code>root_as_url_component</code> option is enabled, it is not neccessary to to specify this parameter. When the <code>root_as_url_component</code> option is enabled, ViewVC URLs with <code>root</code> parameters redirect to locations with the root values embedded in the repository paths.</td>
  </tr>

<h2 id="compat">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>ViewVC's URL format has changed a lot over time, but ViewVC goes out of its way to support URLs using older formats so there aren't broken links when an installation of ViewVC is upgraded. The support is implemented as a set of URL transformations that recognize elements of old-style URLs and convert them to newer equivalents. If any transformations are applied (with some exceptions, mentioned below), ViewVC will issue a single redirect to the transformed URL. Descriptions of the transformations follow.</p>

<h3 id="compat-cvsroot">'<code>cvsroot</code>' Parameter &rArr; '<code>root</code>'</h3>
<p>URLs with a <code>cvsroot</code> parameter will automatically be redirected to URLs with a <code>root</code> parameter instead.</p>

<h3 id="compat-only_with_tag">'<code>only_with_tag</code>' Parameter &rArr; '<code>pathrev</code>'</h3>
<p>URLs with an <code>only_with_tag</code> parameter will automatically be redirected to URLs with a <code>pathrev</code> parameter instead.</p>

<h3 id="compat-oldcheckout">'<code>~checkout~</code>' Magic Path Prefix &rArr; '<code>*checkout*</code>'</h3>
<p>URLs with a <code>~checkout~</code> path prefix get interpreted just like URLs with a '*checkout*' prefix. There is currently no redirect, but there could be in the future.</p>

<h3 id="compat-checkout">'<code>*checkout*</code>' Magic Path Prefix &rArr; '<code>view=co</code>'</h3>
<p>When the <code>checkout_magic</code> configuration option is disabled, URLs with a <code>*checkout*</code> magic prefix will redirect to an equivalent URL that does not use the prefix.</p>

<h3 id="compat-root">'<code>root</code>' Parameter &rArr; Root Path Component</h3>
<p>When the <code>root_as_url_component</code> configuration option is enabled, URLs with a <code>root</code> parameter will redirect to an equivalent URL with the root name embedded in the path.</p>

<h3 id="compat-rev">'<code>rev</code>' Parameter &rArr; '<code>revision</code>' and '<code>pathrev</code>'</h3>
<p>CVS URLs with a <code>rev</code> parameter will redirect to URLs with a <code>revision</code> parameter instead. Subversion URLs with a <code>rev</code> parameter will redirect to URLs with a <code>pathrev</code> parameter, in order to account for the how the Subversion backend used to look up paths before <code>pathrev</code> was introduced.</p>

<h3 id="compat-diff">'<code>.diff</code>' Suffix &rArr; Diff View</h3>
<p>When ViewVC encounters a invalid repository path that ends in <code>.diff</code>, and stripping that ending yields a valid file path, it will redirect to a diff view of the file.</p>

<h3 id="compat-tgz">'<code>.tar.gz</code>' Suffix &rArr; '<code>view=tar</code>'</h3>
<p>When ViewVC encounters a invalid repository path that ends in <code>.tar.gz</code>, <code>/root.tar.gz</code>, or <code>/REPOS-root.tar.gz</code>, and stripping the ending yields a valid directory path, it will redirect to a URL to download a tarball of the directory.</p>

<h3 id="compat-tarball">'<code>tarball=1</code>' Parameter &rArr; '<code>view=tar</code>'</h3>
<p>A <code>tarball=1</code> parameter is treated pretty much like a <code>view=tar</code> parameter. There is no redirect when it is encountered, but there could be in the future.</p>

<h3 id="compat-graph">'<code>graph=1</code>' Parameter &rArr; '<code>view=graph</code>'</h3>
<p>A <code>graph=1</code> parameter is treated like a <code>view=graph</code> parameter. There is currently no redirect when it is encountered, but there could be one in the future.</p>

"""Module to analyze Python source code; for syntax coloring tools.

Interface:

    tags = fontify(pytext, searchfrom, searchto)

The PYTEXT argument is a string containing Python source code.  The
(optional) arguments SEARCHFROM and SEARCHTO may contain a slice in
PYTEXT.

The returned value is a list of tuples, formatted like this:

    [('keyword', 0, 6, None),
     ('keyword', 11, 17, None),
     ('comment', 23, 53, None),
     ...
    ]
    
The tuple contents are always like this:

    (tag, startindex, endindex, sublist)
    
TAG is one of 'keyword', 'string', 'comment' or 'identifier'
SUBLIST is not used, hence always None.

Module difflib -- helpers for computing deltas between objects.

Function get_close_matches(word, possibilities, n=3, cutoff=0.6):

    Use SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.

    word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a
    string).

    possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word
    (typically a list of strings).

    Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to
    return.  n must be > 0.

    Optional arg cutoff (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  Possibilities
    that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.

    The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned
    in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.

    >>> get_close_matches("appel", ["ape", "apple", "peach", "puppy"])
    ['apple', 'ape']
    >>> import keyword
    >>> get_close_matches("wheel", keyword.kwlist)
    ['while']
    >>> get_close_matches("apple", keyword.kwlist)

    >>> get_close_matches("accept", keyword.kwlist)

Class SequenceMatcher

SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any
type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic algorithm
predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm published in the late
1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern
matching".  The basic idea is to find the longest contiguous matching
subsequence that contains no "junk" elements (R-O doesn't address junk).
The same idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of the sequences to
the left and to the right of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield
minimal edit sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right"
to people.

Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

>>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
>>>

.ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
sequences are close matches:

>>> print round(s.ratio(), 3)
0.866
>>>

If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
.get_matching_blocks() is handy:

>>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
...     print "a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block
a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
a[8] and b[17] match for 6 elements
a[14] and b[23] match for 15 elements
a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second, use
.get_opcodes():

>>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
...     print "%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode
 equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
 equal a[8:14] b[17:23]
 equal a[14:29] b[23:38]

See Tools/scripts/ndiff.py for a fancy human-friendly file differencer,
which uses SequenceMatcher both to view files as sequences of lines, and
lines as sequences of characters.

See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

SequenceMatcher methods:

__init__(isjunk=None, a='', b='')
    Construct a SequenceMatcher.

    Optional arg isjunk is None (the default), or a one-argument function
    that takes a sequence element and returns true iff the element is junk.
    None is equivalent to passing "lambda x: 0", i.e. no elements are
    considered to be junk.  For example, pass
        lambda x: x in " \\t"
    if you're comparing lines as sequences of characters, and don't want to
    synch up on blanks or hard tabs.

    Optional arg a is the first of two sequences to be compared.  By
    default, an empty string.  The elements of a must be hashable.

    Optional arg b is the second of two sequences to be compared.  By
    default, an empty string.  The elements of b must be hashable.

set_seqs(a, b)
    Set the two sequences to be compared.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher()
    >>> s.set_seqs("abcd", "bcde")
    >>> s.ratio()
    0.75

set_seq1(a)
    Set the first sequence to be compared.

    The second sequence to be compared is not changed.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
    >>> s.ratio()
    0.75
    >>> s.set_seq1("bcde")
    >>> s.ratio()
    1.0
    >>>

    SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the
    second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against many
    sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x) repeatedly for
    each of the other sequences.

    See also set_seqs() and set_seq2().

set_seq2(b)
    Set the second sequence to be compared.

    The first sequence to be compared is not changed.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
    >>> s.ratio()
    0.75
    >>> s.set_seq2("abcd")
    >>> s.ratio()
    1.0
    >>>

    SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the
    second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against many
    sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x) repeatedly for
    each of the other sequences.

    See also set_seqs() and set_seq1().

find_longest_match(alo, ahi, blo, bhi)
    Find longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

    If isjunk is not defined:

    Return (i,j,k) such that a[i:i+k] is equal to b[j:j+k], where
        alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi
        blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi
    and for all (i',j',k') meeting those conditions,
        k >= k'
        i <= i'
        and if i == i', j <= j'

    In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that starts
    earliest in a, and of all those maximal matching blocks that start
    earliest in a, return the one that starts earliest in b.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, " abcd", "abcd abcd")
    >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
    (0, 4, 5)

    If isjunk is defined, first the longest matching block is determined as
    above, but with the additional restriction that no junk element appears
    in the block.  Then that block is extended as far as possible by
    matching (only) junk elements on both sides.  So the resulting block
    never matches on junk except as identical junk happens to be adjacent
    to an "interesting" match.

    Here's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be junk.
    That prevents " abcd" from matching the " abcd" at the tail end of the
    second sequence directly.  Instead only the "abcd" can match, and
    matches the leftmost "abcd" in the second sequence:

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x==" ", " abcd", "abcd abcd")
    >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
    (1, 0, 4)

    If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "ab", "c")
    >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 2, 0, 1)
    (0, 0, 0)

get_matching_blocks()
    Return list of triples describing matching subsequences.

    Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
    a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The triples are monotonically increasing in i
    and in j.

    The last triple is a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and is the only triple
    with n==0.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abxcd", "abcd")
    >>> s.get_matching_blocks()
    [(0, 0, 2), (3, 2, 2), (5, 4, 0)]

get_opcodes()
    Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

    Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2).  The first tuple has
    i1 == j1 == 0, and remaining tuples have i1 == the i2 from the tuple
    preceding it, and likewise for j1 == the previous j2.

    The tags are strings, with these meanings:

    'replace':  a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2]
    'delete':   a[i1:i2] should be deleted.
                Note that j1==j2 in this case.
    'insert':   b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1].
                Note that i1==i2 in this case.
    'equal':    a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2]

    >>> a = "qabxcd"
    >>> b = "abycdf"
    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)
    >>> for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in s.get_opcodes():
    ...    print ("%7s a[%d:%d] (%s) b[%d:%d] (%s)" %
    ...           (tag, i1, i2, a[i1:i2], j1, j2, b[j1:j2]))
     delete a[0:1] (q) b[0:0] ()
      equal a[1:3] (ab) b[0:2] (ab)
    replace a[3:4] (x) b[2:3] (y)
      equal a[4:6] (cd) b[3:5] (cd)
     insert a[6:6] () b[5:6] (f)

ratio()
    Return a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

    Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and M is the
    number of matches, this is 2,0*M / T. Note that this is 1 if the
    sequences are identical, and 0 if they have nothing in common.

    .ratio() is expensive to compute if you haven't already computed
    .get_matching_blocks() or .get_opcodes(), in which case you may want to
    try .quick_ratio() or .real_quick_ratio() first to get an upper bound.

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
    >>> s.ratio()
    0.75
    >>> s.quick_ratio()
    0.75
    >>> s.real_quick_ratio()
    1.0

quick_ratio()
    Return an upper bound on .ratio() relatively quickly.

    This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
    is faster to compute.

real_quick_ratio():
    Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.

    This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
    is faster to compute than either .ratio() or .quick_ratio().

"""ndiff [-q] file1 file2
    or
ndiff (-r1 | -r2) < ndiff_output > file1_or_file2

Print a human-friendly file difference report to stdout.  Both inter-
and intra-line differences are noted.  In the second form, recreate file1
(-r1) or file2 (-r2) on stdout, from an ndiff report on stdin.

In the first form, if -q ("quiet") is not specified, the first two lines
of output are

-: file1
+: file2

Each remaining line begins with a two-letter code:

    "- "    line unique to file1
    "+ "    line unique to file2
    "  "    line common to both files
    "? "    line not present in either input file

Lines beginning with "? " attempt to guide the eye to intraline
differences, and were not present in either input file.  These lines can be
confusing if the source files contain tab characters.

The first file can be recovered by retaining only lines that begin with
"  " or "- ", and deleting those 2-character prefixes; use ndiff with -r1.

The second file can be recovered similarly, but by retaining only "  " and
"+ " lines; use ndiff with -r2; or, on Unix, the second file can be
recovered by piping the output through

    sed -n '/^[+ ] /s/^..//p'

# appear to yield more intuitive difference reports than does diff.  This
# method appears to be the least vulnerable to synching up on blocks
# of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in ordinary text files,
# or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be because this is
# the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of "junk" <wink>.
#
# Note that ndiff makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
# contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they
# synch up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages
# apart.  Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some
# notion of locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.
#
# With respect to junk, an earlier version of ndiff simply refused to
# *start* a match with a junk element.  The result was cases like this:
#     before: private Thread currentThread;
#     after:  private volatile Thread currentThread;
# If you consider whitespace to be junk, the longest contiguous match
# not starting with junk is "e Thread currentThread".  So ndiff reported
# that "e volatil" was inserted between the 't' and the 'e' in "private".
# While an accurate view, to people that's absurd.  The current version
# looks for matching blocks that are entirely junk-free, then extends the
# longest one of those as far as possible but only with matching junk.
# So now "currentThread" is matched, then extended to suck up the
# preceding blank; then "private" is matched, and extended to suck up the
# following blank; then "Thread" is matched; and finally ndiff reports
# that "volatile " was inserted before "Thread".  The only quibble
# remaining is that perhaps it was really the case that " volatile"
# was inserted after "private".  I can live with that <wink>.
#
# NOTE on junk:  the module-level names
#    IS_LINE_JUNK
#    IS_CHARACTER_JUNK
# can be set to any functions you like.  The first one should accept
# a single string argument, and return true iff the string is junk.
# The default is whether the regexp r"\s*#?\s*$" matches (i.e., a
# line without visible characters, except for at most one splat).
# The second should accept a string of length 1 etc.  The default is
# whether the character is a blank or tab (note: bad idea to include
# newline in this!).
#
# After setting those, you can call fcompare(f1name, f2name) with the
# names of the files you want to compare.  The difference report
# is sent to stdout.  Or you can call main(args), passing what would
# have been in sys.argv[1:] had the cmd-line form been used.

# CONFIGURATION
#
# There are three forms of configuration:
#
#       1) edit the viewvc.conf created by the viewvc-install(er)
#       2) as (1), but delete all unchanged entries from viewvc.conf
#       3) do not use viewvc.conf and just edit the defaults in this file
#
# Most users will want to use (1), but there are slight speed advantages
# to the other two options. Note that viewvc.conf values are a bit easier
# to work with since it is raw text, rather than python literal values.

"""ezt.py -- easy templating

ezt templates are simply text files in whatever format you so desire
(such as XML, HTML, etc.) which contain directives sprinkled
throughout.  With these directives it is possible to generate the
dynamic content from the ezt templates.

These directives are enclosed in square brackets.  If you are a
C-programmer, you might be familar with the #ifdef directives of the C
preprocessor 'cpp'.  ezt provides a similar concept.  Additionally EZT
has a 'for' directive, which allows it to iterate (repeat) certain
subsections of the template according to sequence of data items
provided by the application.

The final rendering is performed by the method generate() of the Template
class.  Building template instances can either be done using external
EZT files (convention: use the suffix .ezt for such files):

    >>> template = Template("../templates/log.ezt")

or by calling the parse() method of a template instance directly with 
a EZT template string:

    >>> template = Template()
    >>> template.parse('''<html><head>
    ... <title>[title_string]</title></head>
    ... <body><h1>[title_string]</h1>
    ...    [for a_sequence] <p>[a_sequence]</p>
    ...    [end] <hr />
    ...    The [person] is [if-any state]in[else]out[end].
    ... </body>
    ... </html>
    ... ''')

The application should build a dictionary 'data' and pass it together
with the output fileobject to the templates generate method:

    >>> data = {'title_string' : "A Dummy Page",
    ...         'a_sequence' : ['list item 1', 'list item 2', 'another element'],
    ...         'person': "doctor",
    ...         'state' : None }
    >>> import sys
    >>> template.generate(sys.stdout, data)
    <html><head>
    <title>A Dummy Page</title></head>
    <body><h1>A Dummy Page</h1>
     <p>list item 1</p>
     <p>list item 2</p>
     <p>another element</p>
     <hr />
    The doctor is out.
    </body>
    </html>

Template syntax error reporting should be improved.  Currently it is 
very sparse (template line numbers would be nice):

    >>> Template().parse("[if-any where] foo [else] bar [end unexpected args]")
    Traceback (innermost last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
      File "ezt.py", line 220, in parse
        self.program = self._parse(text)
      File "ezt.py", line 275, in _parse
        raise ArgCountSyntaxError(str(args[1:]))
    ArgCountSyntaxError: ['unexpected', 'args']
    >>> Template().parse("[if unmatched_end]foo[end]")
    Traceback (innermost last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
      File "ezt.py", line 206, in parse
        self.program = self._parse(text)
      File "ezt.py", line 266, in _parse
        raise UnmatchedEndError()
    UnmatchedEndError


Directives
==========

 Several directives allow the use of dotted qualified names refering to objects
 or attributes of objects contained in the data dictionary given to the 
 .generate() method.

 Qualified names
 ---------------

   Qualified names have two basic forms: a variable reference, or a string
   constant. References are a name from the data dictionary with optional
   dotted attributes (where each intermediary is an object with attributes,
   of course).

   Examples:

     [varname]

     [ob.attr]

     ["string"]

 Simple directives
 -----------------

   [QUAL_NAME]

   This directive is simply replaced by the value of the qualified name.
   If the value is a number it's converted to a string before being 
   outputted. If it is None, nothing is outputted. If it is a python file
   object (i.e. any object with a "read" method), it's contents are
   outputted. If it is a callback function (any callable python object
   is assumed to be a callback function), it is invoked and passed an EZT
   Context object as an argument.

   [QUAL_NAME QUAL_NAME ...]

   If the first value is a callback function, it is invoked with an EZT
   Context object as a first argument, and the rest of the values as
   additional arguments.

   Otherwise, the first value defines a substitution format, specifying
   constant text and indices of the additional arguments. The arguments
   are substituted and the result is inserted into the output stream.

   Example:
     ["abc %0 def %1 ghi %0" foo bar.baz]

   Note that the first value can be any type of qualified name -- a string
   constant or a variable reference. Use %% to substitute a percent sign.
   Argument indices are 0-based.

   [include "filename"]  or [include QUAL_NAME]

   This directive is replaced by content of the named include file. Note
   that a string constant is more efficient -- the target file is compiled
   inline. In the variable form, the target file is compiled and executed
   at runtime.

 Block directives
 ----------------

   [for QUAL_NAME] ... [end]
   
   The text within the [for ...] directive and the corresponding [end]
   is repeated for each element in the sequence referred to by the
   qualified name in the for directive.  Within the for block this
   identifiers now refers to the actual item indexed by this loop
   iteration.

   [if-any QUAL_NAME [QUAL_NAME2 ...]] ... [else] ... [end]

   Test if any QUAL_NAME value is not None or an empty string or list.
   The [else] clause is optional.  CAUTION: Numeric values are
   converted to string, so if QUAL_NAME refers to a numeric value 0,
   the then-clause is substituted!

   [if-index INDEX_FROM_FOR odd] ... [else] ... [end]
   [if-index INDEX_FROM_FOR even] ... [else] ... [end]
   [if-index INDEX_FROM_FOR first] ... [else] ... [end]
   [if-index INDEX_FROM_FOR last] ... [else] ... [end]
   [if-index INDEX_FROM_FOR NUMBER] ... [else] ... [end]

   These five directives work similar to [if-any], but are only useful
   within a [for ...]-block (see above).  The odd/even directives are
   for example useful to choose different background colors for
   adjacent rows in a table.  Similar the first/last directives might
   be used to remove certain parts (for example "Diff to previous"
   doesn't make sense, if there is no previous).

   [is QUAL_NAME STRING] ... [else] ... [end]
   [is QUAL_NAME QUAL_NAME] ... [else] ... [end]

   The [is ...] directive is similar to the other conditional
   directives above.  But it allows to compare two value references or
   a value reference with some constant string.

   [define VARIABLE] ... [end]

   The [define ...] directive allows you to create and modify template
   variables from within the template itself.  Essentially, any data
   between inside the [define ...] and its matching [end] will be
   expanded using the other template parsing and output generation
   rules, and then stored as a string value assigned to the variable
   VARIABLE.  The new (or changed) variable is then available for use
   with other mechanisms such as [is ...] or [if-any ...], as long as
   they appear later in the template.

   [format STRING] ... [end]

   The format directive controls how the values substituted into
   templates are escaped before they are put into the output stream. It
   has no effect on the literal text of the templates, only the output
   from [QUAL_NAME ...] directives. STRING can be one of "raw" "html" 
   or "xml". The "raw" mode leaves the output unaltered. The "html" and
   "xml" modes escape special characters using entity escapes (like
   &quot; and &gt;)

   [format CALLBACK]
 
   Python applications using EZT can provide custom formatters as callback
   variables. "[format CALLBACK][QUAL_NAME][end]" is in most cases
   equivalent to "[CALLBACK QUAL_NAME]"

    Takes the input, assuming it is Python code and formats it into
    colored XHTML. When called without parameters the script tries to
    work in CGI mode. It looks for a field 'script=URL' and tries to
    use that URL as input file. If it can't find this field, the path
    info (the part of the URL following the CGI script name) is
    tried. In case no host is given, the host where the CGI script
    lives and HTTP are used.
 
    * Uses Just van Rossum's PyFontify version 0.3 to tag Python scripts.

    The following snippet is a small shell script I use for viewing
    Python scripts via less on Unix:

pyless:

# Browse pretty printed Python code using ANSI codes for highlighting
py2html -stdout -format:ansi -mode:color $* | less -r

    History:

    0.8: Added patch by Patrick Lynch to have py2html.py use style
         sheets for markup
    0.7: Added patch by Ville Skyttä to make py2html.py output
         valid XHTML.
    0.6: Fixed a bug in .escape_html(); thanks to Vespe Savikko for
         finding this one.
    0.5: Added a few suggestions by Kevin Ng to make the CGI version
         a little more robust.

        * interfaces:

           file_filter -- takes two files: input & output (may be stdin/stdout)
           filter -- takes a string and returns the highlighted version

        * to create an instance use:

          c = PrettyPrint(tagfct,format,mode)

          above table if you plan to use PyFontify.fontify as
          tagfct

          "name" given to the slice left:right in text and sublist is a

  # 'pathrev' is a tag name for CVS repositories and a revision number for
  # Subversion repositories. It's automatically propagated between pages by
  # logic in the Request.get_link() function which adds it to links like a
  # sticky variable. When 'pathrev' is set, directory listings only include
  # entries that exist in the specified revision or tag. Similarly, log pages
  # will only show revisions preceding the point in history specified by
  # 'pathrev.' Markup, checkout, and annotate pages show the 'pathrev'
  # revision of files by default when no other revision is specified.
  #
  # In Subversion repositories, paths are always considered to refer to the
  # pathrev revision. For example, if there is a "circle.jpg" in revision 3,
  # which is renamed and modified as "square.jpg" in revision 4, the original
  # circle image is visible at the following URLs:
  #
  #     *checkout*/circle.jpg?pathrev=3
  #     *checkout*/square.jpg?revision=3
  #     *checkout*/square.jpg?revision=3&pathrev=4
  # 
  # Note that the following:
  #
  #     *checkout*/circle.jpg?rev=3
  #
  # now gets redirected to one of the following URLs:
  #
  #     *checkout*/circle.jpg?pathrev=3  (for Subversion)
  #     *checkout*/circle.jpg?revision=3  (for CVS)

    <p>The directory listing view should be a familiar sight to any
    computer user. It shows the path of the current directory being viewed
    at the top of the page. Below that is a table summarizing the
    directory contents, and then comes actual contents, a sortable list of
    all files and subdirectories inside the current directory.</p>

    <p><a name="summary"></a>The summary table is made up of some or all
    of the following rows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="summary-files-shown"><strong>Files Shown</strong></a>
      - Number of files shown in the directory listing. This might be less
      than the actual number of files in the directory if a
      <a href="#option-search">regular expression search</a> is in place,
      hiding files which don't meet the search criteria. In CVS directory
      listings, this row will also have a link to toggle display of
      <a href="help_rootview.html#dead-files">dead files</a>, if any are
      present.</li>

      <li><a name="summary-revision"><strong>Directory
      Revision</strong></a> - For Subversion directories only.
      Shown as "# of #" where the first number is the most recent
      repository revision where the directory (or a path underneath it)
      was modified. The second number is just the latest repository
      revision. Both numbers are links to
      <a href="help_rootview.html#view-rev">revision views</a></li>

     <li><a name="summary-sticky-revision-tag"><strong>Sticky
     Revision/Tag</strong></a> - shows the current
     <a href="help_rootview.html#sticky-revision-tag">sticky revision or

     <li><a name="summary-search"><strong>Current Search</strong></a> -
     If a <a href="#option-search">regular expression search</a> is in place,
     shows the search string.</li>

     <li><a name="summary-query"><strong>Query</strong></a> - Provides
     a link to a <a href="help_rootview.html#view-query">query form</a>
     for the directory</li>
   </ul>

  <p><a name="list"></a>The actual directory list is a table with
  filenames and directory names in one column and information about the
  most recent revisions where each file or directory was modified in the
  other columns. Column headers can be clicked to sort the directory
  entries in order by a column, and clicked again to reverse the sort
  order.</p>

  <p>
  <!-- If using directory.ezt template -->
  File names are links to <a href="help_log.html">log views</a>
  showing a list of revisions where a file was modified. Revision
  numbers are links to either
  <a href="help_rootview.html#view-markup">view</a>
  or <a href="help_rootview.html#view-checkout">download</a> a file
  (depending on its file type). The links are reversed for directories.
  Directory revision numbers are links to <a href="help_log.html">log
  views</a>, while directory names are links showing the contents of those
  directories.

  <!-- If using dir_alt.ezt template -->
  <!--
  File and directory names are links to retrieve their contents.
  File links may be either
  <a href="help_rootview.html#view-markup">view</a>
  or <a href="help_rootview.html#view-download">download</a> links
  depending on the file type. Directory links go to directory
  listings. Revision numbers are links to <a href="help_log.html">log
  views</a> showing lists of revisions where a file or directory was
  modified.
  -->

  Also, in CVS repositories with the
  <a href="help_rootview.html#view-graph">graph view</a> enabled, there
  will be small
  <img src="images/cvsgraph_16x16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="graph">
  icons next to file names which are links to revision graphs.</p>

  <p>Depending on how ViewVC is configured, there may be more options
  at the bottom of directory pages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="option-search"><strong>Regular expression
    search</strong></a> - If enabled, will show a form field accepting
    a search string (a
    <a href="http://doc.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html">python regular
    expression</a>). Once submitted, only files that have at least
    one occurance of the expression will show up in directory listings.
    </li>
    <li><a name="option-tarball"><strong>Tarball download</strong></a> -
    If enabled, will show a link to download a gzipped tar archive of
    the directory contents.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> 
    Select your parameters for querying the CVS commit database in the
    form at the top of the page.  You
    can search for multiple matches by typing a comma-seperated list
    into the text fields.  Regular expressions, and wildcards are also
    supported.  Blank text input fields are treated as wildcards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any of the text entry fields can take a comma-seperated list of
    search arguments.  For example, to search for all commits from
    authors <em>jpaint</em> and <em>gstein</em>, just type: <code>jpaint,
    gstein</code> in the <em>Author</em> input box.  If you are searching
    for items containing spaces or quotes, you will need to quote your
    request.  For example, the same search above with quotes is:
    <code>"jpaint", "gstein"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>                           
    Wildcard and regular expression searches are entered in a similar
    way to the quoted requests.  You must quote any wildcard or
    regular expression request, and a command character preceeds the
    first quote.  The command character <code>l</code>(lowercase L) is for wildcard
    searches, and the wildcard character is a percent (<code>%</code>).  The
    command character for regular expressions is <code>r</code>, and is
    passed directly to MySQL, so you'll need to refer to the MySQL
    manual for the exact regex syntax.  It is very similar to Perl.  A
    wildard search for all files with a <em>.py</em> extention is:
    <code>l"%.py"</code> in the <em>File</em> input box.  The same search done
    with a regular expression is: <code>r".*\.py"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>                  
    All search types can be mixed, as long as they are seperated by
    commas.

  <p><em>ViewVC</em> is a WWW interface for CVS and Subversion
  repositories. It allows you to browse the files and directories in a
  repository while showing you metadata from the repository history: log
  messages, modification dates, author names, revision numbers, copy
  history, and so on. It provides several different views of repository
  data to help you find the information you are looking for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="view-dir" href="help_dirview.html"><strong>Directory
    View</strong></a> - Shows a list of files and subdirectories in a
    directory of the repository, along with metadata like author names and
    log entries.</li>

    <li><a name="view-log" href="help_log.html"><strong>Log
    View</strong></a> - Shows a revision by revision list of all the
    changes that have made to a file or directory in the repository, with
    metadata and links to views of each revision.</li>

    <li><a name="view-markup"><strong>File Contents View (Markup
    View)</strong></a> - Shows the contents of a file at a particular
    revision, with revision information at the top of the page. File
    revisions which are GIF, PNG, or JPEG images are displayed inline on
    the page. Other file types are displayed as marked up text. The markup
    may be limited to turning URLs and email addresses into links, or
    configured to show colorized source code.</li>

    <li><a name="view-checkout"><strong>File Download (Checkout
    View)</strong></a> - Retrieves the unaltered contents of a file
    revision. Browsers may try to display the file, or just save it to
    disk.</li>

    <li><a name="view-annotate"><strong>File Annotate View</strong></a> -
    Shows the contents of a file revision and breaks it down line by line,
    showing the revision number where each one was last modified, along
    with links and other information. <em>This view is disabled in some
    ViewVC configurations</em></li>

    <li><a name="view-diff"><strong>File Diff View</strong></a> - Shows
    the changes made between two revisions of a file</li>

    <li><a name="view-tarball"><strong>Directory Tarball View</strong> -
    Retrieves a gzipped tar archive containing the contents of a
    directory.<em>This view is disabled in the default ViewVC
    configuration.</em></li>

    <li><a name="view-query"><strong>Directory Query View</strong></a> -
    Shows information about changes made to all subdirectories and files
    under a parent directory, sorted and filtered by criteria you specify.
    <em>This view is disabled in the default ViewVC configuration.</em>
    </li>

    <li><a name="view-rev"><strong>Revision View</strong> - Shows
    information about a revision including log message, author, and a list
    of changed paths. <em>For Subversion repositories only.</em></li>

    <li><a name="view-graph"><strong>Graph View</strong></a> - Shows a
    graphical representation of a file's revisions and branches complete
    with tag and author names and links to markup and diff pages.
    <em>For CVS repositories only, and disabled in the default
    configuration.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="multiple-repositories">Multiple Repositories</a></h3>

  <p>A single installation of ViewVC is often used to provide access to
  more than one repository. In these installations, ViewVC shows a
  <em>Project Root</em> drop down box in the top right corner of every
  generated page to allow for quick access to any repository.</p>

  <h3><a name="sticky-revision-tag">Sticky Revision and Tag</a></h3>

  <p>By default, ViewVC will show the files and directories and revisions
  that currently exist in the repository. But it's also possible to browse
  the contents of a repository at a point in its past history by choosing
  a "sticky tag" (in CVS) or a "sticky revision" (in Subversion) from the
  forms at the top of directory and log pages. They're called sticky
  because once they're chosen, they stick around when you navigate to
  other pages, until you reset them. When they're set, directory and log
  pages only show revisions preceding the specified point in history. In
  CVS, when a tag refers to a branch or a revision on a branch, only
  revisions from the branch history are shown, including branch points and
  their preceding revisions.</p>

  <h3><a name="dead-files">Dead Files</a></h3>

  <p>In CVS directory listings, ViewVC can optionally display dead files.
  Dead files are files which used to be in a directory but are currently
  deleted, or files which just don't exist in the currently selected
  <a href="#sticky-revision-tag">sticky tag</a>. Dead files cannot be
  shown in Subversion repositories. The only way to see a deleted file in
  a Subversion directory is to navigate to a sticky revision where the
  file previously existed.</p>

  <h3><a name="artificial-tags">Artificial Tags</a></h3>

  <p>In CVS Repositories, ViewVC adds artificial tags <em>HEAD</em> and
  <em>MAIN</em> to tag listings and accepts them in place of revision
  numbers and real tag names in all URLs. <em>MAIN</em> acts like a branch
  tag pointing at the default branch, while <em>HEAD</em> acts like a
  revision tag pointing to the latest revision on the default branch. The
  default branch is usually just the trunk, but may be set to other
  branches inside individual repository files. CVS will always check out
  revisions from a file's default branch when no other branch is specified
  on the command line.</p>

    into the text fields.  Regular expressions, and wildcards are also
    supported.  Blank text input fields are treated as wildcards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any of the text entry fields can take a comma-seperated list of
    search arguments.  For example, to search for all commits from
    authors <em>jpaint</em> and <em>gstein</em>, just type: <strong>jpaint,
    gstein</strong> in the <em>Author</em> input box.  If you are searching
    for items containing spaces or quotes, you will need to quote your
    request.  For example, the same search above with quotes is:
    <strong>"jpaint", "gstein"</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>                           

    Wildcard and regular expression searches are entered in a similar
    way to the quoted requests.  You must quote any wildcard or
    regular expression request, and a command charactor preceeds the
    first quote.  The command charactor <strong>l</strong> is for wildcard
    searches, and the wildcard charactor is a percent (<strong>%</strong>).  The
    command charactor for regular expressions is <strong>r</strong>, and is
    passed directly to MySQL, so you'll need to refer to the MySQL
    manual for the exact regex syntax.  It is very similar to Perl.  A
    wildard search for all files with a <em>.py</em> extention is:
    <strong>l"%.py"</strong> in the <em>File</em> input box.  The same search done
    with a regular expression is: <strong>r".*\.py"</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>                  
    All search types can be mixed, as long as they are seperated by
    commas.
  </p>

I.   BASIC INSTALLATION


Let ViewVC use the viewsvn templates folder as templates. You can either delete the original
templates folder in the ViewVC installation directory and copy the one from this archive to
the ViewVC installation directory or copy the templates folder from this archive with a different 
name to the ViewVC installation directory and change the template_dir option in viewvc.conf

template_dir = templates-viewsvn

Leave the section [templates] as is, thus do not override any templates. 



 
II.  TWEAKS


1. Set your own favicon

Modify include/header.ezt, line 9, to include your favicon.


2. Let your own logo appear in the upper right area and link to your homepage. 

Modify include/header.ezt, line 78, to include your link and logo.


3. Enable TortoiseSVN checkout links.

If you are certain that most of your guest use TortoiseSVN you can give them the ability
to use TortoiseSVN checkout links 
(see http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-repository-links.html). This wil
only work if all your repositories share the same base location, e.g. http://svn.server/svn/.
This is mostly the case if you are using the mod_dav_svn SVNParentPath directive.
 
Modify include/dir_footer.ezt, line 44. Enable this section and configure your subversion location. 




III. EXTRAS


1.   fix-blame-output.diff

If you are running ViewVC 1.0 and you are suffering from a broken blame/annotate output because of
long author names you can apply this patch. Note that Subversion 1.3.1 or higher is required.


2.   svnindex.xsl & svnindex.css

If you are using mod_dav_svn to host your repository you can teach it to use a stylesheet if you are 
browsing the repository directly. Take a look at the SVNIndexXSLT directive for more information.
You can use the .xsl and .css from the extras folder to get a look & feel that is similiar to this
ViewVC template. Note that these stylesheets knows nothing about ViewVC. You have to teach
svnindex.xsl where the [docroot] folder exists. If it is /docroot you have to change nothing, 
otherwise edit line 68, 82 and 97.




IV.  EXAMPLE VIEWVC.CONF

I.   INTRODUCTION


ViewVC is a Subversion and CVS webbased repository viewer. Templates-viewsvn is
a set of templates for a different look & feel.

Warning:
Do not use this template set if you plan to view cvs repositories through ViewVC! 
This template-set is heavily trimmed for Subversion needs. Special CVS features are 
untested, possibly disabled or broken.

Please report enhancemants back to the ViewVC project or to me.
jpeters7677@gmx.de




II.  COMPATABILITY


This template is compatible with ViewVC 1.0.x

  <p> 
    Select your parameters for querying the CVS commit database.  You
    can search for multiple matches by typing a comma-seperated list
    into the text fields.  Regular expressions, and wildcards are also
    supported.  Blank text input fields are treated as wildcards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any of the text entry fields can take a comma-seperated list of
    search arguments.  For example, to search for all commits from
    authors <em>jpaint</em> and <em>gstein</em>, just type: <strong>jpaint,
    gstein</strong> in the <em>Author</em> input box.  If you are searching
    for items containing spaces or quotes, you will need to quote your
    request.  For example, the same search above with quotes is:
    <strong>"jpaint", "gstein"</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>                           

    Wildcard and regular expression searches are entered in a similar
    way to the quoted requests.  You must quote any wildcard or
    regular expression request, and a command charactor preceeds the
    first quote.  The command charactor <strong>l</strong> is for wildcard
    searches, and the wildcard charactor is a percent (<strong>%</strong>).  The
    command charactor for regular expressions is <strong>r</strong>, and is
    passed directly to MySQL, so you'll need to refer to the MySQL
    manual for the exact regex syntax.  It is very similar to Perl.  A
    wildard search for all files with a <em>.py</em> extention is:
    <strong>l"%.py"</strong> in the <em>File</em> input box.  The same search done
    with a regular expression is: <strong>r".*\.py"</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>                  
    All search types can be mixed, as long as they are seperated by
    commas.
  </p>

#
# Configuration file for ViewVC
#
# Information on ViewVC is located at the following web site:
#     http://viewvc.org/
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# BASIC CONFIGURATION
#
# For correct operation, you will probably need to change the following
# configuration variables:
#
#    cvs_roots (for CVS)
#    svn_roots (for Subversion)
#    root_parents (for CVS or Subversion)
#    default_root
#    rcs_path or cvsnt_exe_path
#    mime_types_file 
#
# It is usually desirable to change the following variables:
#
#    address
#    forbidden
#
#    use_enscript
#    use_cvsgraph
#
# For Python source colorization:
#
#    py2html_path
#
# To optimize delivery of ViewVC static files:
#
#    docroot
#
# To customize the display of ViewVC for your site:
#
#    template_dir
#    the [templates] override section
#

#
# FORMAT INFORMATION
#
# This file is delineated by sections, specified in [brackets]. Within each
# section, are a number of configuration settings. These settings take the
# form of: name = value. Values may be continued on the following line by
# indenting the continued line.
#
# WARNING: indentation *always* means continuation. name=value lines should
#          always start in column zero.
#
# Comments should always start in column zero, and are identified with "#".
#
# Certain configuration settings may have multiple values. These should be
# separated by a comma. The settings where this is allowed are noted below.
#
# Any other setting that requires special syntax is noted at that setting.
# 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[general]

#
# This setting specifies each of the CVS roots on your system and assigns
# names to them. Each root should be given by a "name: path" value. Multiple
# roots should be separated by commas and can be placed on separate lines.
#
cvs_roots = cvs: /home/cvsroot

#
# This setting specifies each of the Subversion roots (repositories)
# on your system and assigns names to them. Each root should be given
# by a "name: path" value. Multiple roots should be separated by
# commas and can be placed on separate lines.
#
#svn_roots = svn: /home/svnrepos

# The 'root_parents' setting specifies a list of directories in which
# any number of repositories may reside.  Rather than force you to add
# a new entry to 'cvs_roots' or 'svn_roots' each time you create a new
# repository, ViewVC rewards you for organising all your repositories
# under a few parent directories by allowing you to simply specifiy
# just those parent directories.  ViewVC will then notice each
# repository in that directory as a new root whose name is the
# subdirectory of the parent path in which that repository lives.
#
# You can specify multiple parent paths separated by commas or new lines.
#
# Caution: these names can, of course, clash with names you have
# defined in your cvs_roots or svn_roots configuration items.  If this
# occurs, you can either rename the offending repository on disk, or
# grant new names to the clashing item in cvs_roots or svn_roots.
# Each parent path is processed sequentially, so repositories under
# later parent paths may override earlier ones.
#
#root_parents = /home/svn-repositories : svn,
#               /home/cvs-repositories : cvs

# this is the name of the default root
# (ignored when root_as_url_component is turned on)

# uncomment if the RCS binaries are not on the standard path
#rcs_path = /usr/bin/

# ViewVC can use CVSNT (www.cvsnt.org) instead of the RCS 
# utilities to retrieve information from CVS repositories.
# To enable use of CVSNT, set the "cvsnt_exe_path" value
# to the path of the CVSNT executable. (If CVSNT is on the
# standard path, you can also set it to the name of the
# CVSNT executable). By default "cvsnt_exe_path" is set to
# "cvs" on Windows and is not set on other platforms.
#
#cvsnt_exe_path =
#cvsnt_exe_path = cvs
#cvsnt_exe_path = K:\Program Files\cvsnt\cvs.exe
#cvsnt_exe_path = /usr/bin/cvs

# use rcsparse python module to retrieve cvs repository information instead
# of invoking rcs utilities. this feature is experimental
use_rcsparse = 0

# uncomment if the svn command-line utilities are not on the standard path
#svn_path = /usr/bin/

#
# This is a pathname to a MIME types file to help viewvc to guess the
# correct MIME type on checkout.
#
# If you are having problems with the default guess on the MIME type, then
# uncomment this option and point it at a MIME type file.
#
# For example, you can use the mime.types from apache here:
#mime_types_file = /usr/local/apache/conf/mime.types

# This address is shown in the footer of the generated pages. 
# It must be replaced with the address of the local repository maintainer.
address = <a href="mailto:cvs-admin@insert.your.domain.here">No admin address has been configured</a>

#
# This should contain a list of modules (that is, top-level directories within 
# repositories) that should not be displayed (by default or by explicit path
# specification).
#
# This configuration can be a simple list of modules, or it can get quite
# complex:
#
#   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it
#      is NOT forbidden. Whenever this form is seen, then all modules will
#      be forbidden unless one of the "!" modules match.
#
#   *) Shell-style "glob" expressions may be used. "*" will match any
#      sequence of zero or more characters, "?" will match any single
#      character, "[seq]" will match any character in seq, and "[!seq]"
#      will match any character not in seq.
#
#   *) Tests are performed in sequence. The first match will terminate the
#      testing. This allows for more complex allow/deny patterns.
#
# Tests are case-sensitive.
#
# NOTE: This is for the hiding of modules within repositories, *not* 
# for the hiding of repositories (roots) themselves.
#
# Some examples:
#
# Disallow "example" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example
#
# Disallow "example1" and "example2" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example1, example2
#
# Allow *only* "example1" and "example2":
#   forbidden = !example1, !example2
#
# Forbid modules starting with "x":
#   forbidden = x*
#
# Allow modules starting with "x" but no others:
#   forbidden = !x*
#
# Allow "xml", forbid other modules starting with "x", and allow the rest:
#   forbidden = !xml, x*, !*
#
forbidden =

#
# This is similar to 'forbidden', but differs in some key ways:
#
#   *) Rather than shell-style "glob" expressions, the values in this
#      list are regular expressions.  You can still prepend a ! character
#      to each regular expression to invert its meaning, though.
#
#   *) It compares not against modules only, but against paths consisting
#      of the repository (or root) name plus the path of the versioned file
#      or directory to be tested.  For example, to see if the user is 
#      authorized to see the path "/trunk/www/index.html" in the repository
#      whose root name is "svnrepos", this authorizer will test the path
#      "svnrepos/trunk/www/index.html" against the list of forbidden regular
#      expressions.  Directory paths will be terminated by a forward slash.
#
# NOTE: Use of this configuration option will *disable* any configuration of
# the 'forbidden' option -- they cannot be used simultaneously.
#
# Some examples:
#
#    Disallow files named "PRIVATE", but allow all others:
#       forbiddenre = /PRIVATE$
#
#    Allow only the "example1" and "example2" roots and the paths inside them,
#    disallowing all others (which can be done in multiple ways):
#       forbiddenre = !^example1(/|$), !^example2(/|$)/
#       forbiddenre = !^example[12](/|$)
#
#    Only allow visibility of HTML files and the directories that hold them:
#       forbiddenre = !^.*(/|\.html)$
#
forbiddenre = 

#
# This option provides a mechanism for custom key/value pairs to be
# available to templates. These are stored in key/value files (KV files).
#
# Pathnames to the KV files are listed here, specified as absolute paths
# or relative to this configuration file. The kV files follow the same
# format as this configuration file. It may have multiple, user-defined
# sections, and user-defined options in those sections. These are all
# placed into a structure available to the templates as:
#
#    kv.SECTION.OPTION
#
# Note that an option name can be dotted. For example:
#
#    [my_images]
#    logos.small = /images/small-logo.png
#    logos.big = /images/big-logo.png
#
# Templates can use these with a directive like: [kv.my_images.logos.small]
#
# Note that sections across multiple files will be merged. If two files
# have a [my_images] section, then the options will be merged together.
# If two files have the same option name in a section, then one will
# overwrite the other (it is unspecified regarding which "wins").
#
# To further categorize the KV files, and how the values are provided to
# the templates, a KV file name may be annotated with an additional level
# of dotted naming. For example:
#
#    kv_files = [asf]kv/images.conf
#
# Assuming the same section as above, the template would refer to an image
# using [kv.asf.my_images.logos.small]
#
# Lastly, it is possible to use %lang% in the filenames to specify a
# substitution of the selected language-tag.
#
kv_files =

# example:
# kv_files = kv/file1.conf, kv/file2.conf, [i18n]kv/%lang%_data.conf
#

#
# The languages available to ViewVC. There are several i18n mechanisms
# available:
#
#   1) using key/value extension system and reading KV files based on
#      the selected language
#   2) GNU gettext to substitute text in the templates
#   3) using different templates, based on the selected language
#
# ### NOTE: at the moment, the GNU gettext style is not implemented
#
# This option is a comma-separated list of language-tag values. The first
# language-tag listed is the default language, and will be used if an
# Accept-Language header is not present in the request, or none of the
# user's requested languages are available. If there are ties on the
# selection of a language, then the first to appear in the list is chosen.
#
languages = en-us

# other examples:
#
# languages = en-us, de
# languages = en-us, en-gb, de
# languages = de, fr, en-us

DESCRIPTION

This file contains special instructions for setting up ViewVC on Windows. It
will take you through a basic installation and tell you how to set up optional
features like code colorizing and the MySQL commit database.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
REQUIREMENTS

ViewVC requires the Python interpreter which you can download from

  http://python.org/

and the Python for Windows Extensions which are at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

For CVS support, ViewVC also requires that the CVSNT client (cvs.exe) OR the
RCS tools (rlog.exe, rcsdiff.exe, and co.exe) be installed on your computer.
CVSNT is available from

  http://www.cvsnt.org/wiki

and RCS can be obtained from:

  http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/

For Subversion support, you'll need to have the Subversion Python bindings
installed. Binaries are available from the Subversion website at:

  http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91

Note that if you use binaries, you have to be running the same version of
python as the binaries were built for. For example, you cannot use Subversion
bindings built for Python 2.3 with Python 2.4. Instructions for building
the binaries from source are available here:

  http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/INSTALL

The Subversion bindings also require you to have diff.exe installed in a
directory on your system PATH. diff.exe is available as part of the GnuWin32
project's DiffUtils package at http://gnuwin32.sf.net/.

Once you've got Python and CVSNT or RCS or the Subversion bindings installed,
you can test out ViewVC before you install it by running:

  python bin\standalone.py -r <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY>

The standalone server has a number of features (including a GUI interface)
which you can find out about by running

  python bin\standalone.py --help

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
BASIC INSTALLATION

Run the ViewVC install script with

  python viewvc-install

The script will copy the source files into an installation directory that you
specify, store some path information, and compile the ViewVC library files into
Python bytecode.

After the installation is finished you will need to edit the viewvc.conf file
in the folder you installed to. The comments in that file tell you exactly what
to do.

With the config file set up you should be able to double-click standalone.py
and access your repository with a web browser.

See the sections below for information on setting up optional features and
troubleshooting. From here on <PYTHON_DIR> will stand for the Python root
directory (usually something like C:\Python22) and <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR> will
represent the directory where ViewVC has been installed to (default is
C:\Program Files\viewvc-VERSION).

SERVER CONFIGURATION

If you want to make ViewVC available to a network (rather than using it on a
standalone machine), you will need to configure a web server to host it. This
section includes instructions for setting up ViewVC on two commonly used
Windows web servers, IIS and Apache.

With IIS, you can run ViewVC in CGI mode or ASP mode (or both modes). ASP mode
gives better performance (faster page loads), but is harder to set up and may
be less stable. CGI mode is stable and easy to set up but slower.

On Apache, you can use CGI mode or Mod_Python mode or both modes at once.
Mod_Python mode is faster than CGI mode.

CGI Mode On IIS

  1) Copy viewvc.cgi and query.cgi from <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\bin\cgi to a
  folder that is accessible through your web server.

  2) Start up the IIS "Internet Services Manager" and right click a virtual
  server or virtual directory that contains the files you just copied. Choose
  "Properties" from the context menu that appears.

  3) On the properties dialog that appears, navigate to [Home | Virtual]
  Directory -> Application Settings -> Configuration. This will bring up
  another dialog box called "Application Configuration".

  4) On the "App Mappings" tab choose "Add". Fill in the following information

                 Executable:  <PYTHON_DIR>\python.exe "%s"
                  Extension:  cgi
              Script Engine:  checked
     Check that file exists:  unchecked

  That is all. Assuming you've set up viewvc.conf to point to your
  repositories, the CGI pages should run. See the Troubleshooting section below
  if there are any problems.

ASP Mode On IIS

  In order to run ViewVC with ASP, you will need to enable Python ActiveX
  scripting and to install the included Aspfool ISAPI filter on whatever
  virtual server is being used to serve the viewvc pages. Step by step
  instructions follow below. Aspfool is located in the windows\aspfool folder.

  To set up ASP mode, follow these steps:

  1) Run <PYTHON_DIR>\Lib\site-packages\win32comext\axscript\client\pyscript.py
  to register Python as an ASP scripting language. (More documentation on this
  is at http://www.python.org/windows/win32com/ActiveXScripting.html)

  2) Copy the viewvc.asp and query.asp files from
  <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\bin\asp to a folder that is accessible through your web
  server.

  3) Start up the IIS "Internet Services Manager" and right click on the
  virtual server that contains the files you just copied. Choose "Properties"
  from the context menu that appears.

  4) On the properties dialog that appears, click the "ISAPI Filters" tab.
  Click the "add" button and enter the following information:

     Filter Name:  aspfool
      Executable:  aspfool.dll

  After you save these changes, the ViewVC ASP pages should begin to work.

CGI Mode on Apache

  Follow the instructions under "Apache Configuration" in the ViewVC INSTALL
  file.

Mod_Python Mode on Apache

  There are probably ten thousand different ways to set up Apache, mod_python,
  and ViewVC together. Here are some instructions that work for me using
  Mod_Python 3.0.3 and Apache 2.0.46. If any Apache gurus want to contribute
  better instructions, I'd be happy to include them here.

  1) Run the win32 mod_python installer from www.modpython.org.

  2) Add the following line to the "Global Environment" section of httpd.conf

     LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so

  3) Copy viewvc.py, query.py, handler.py, and .htaccess from
  <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\bin\mod_python to a folder being served by apache. Make
  sure overrides are allowed in this folder. The relevant parent directory in
  httpd.conf should have "AllowOverride All" set, or at least "AllowOverride
  FileInfo Options".

ENSCRIPT HIGHLIGHTING

To use enscript, you'll have to install the enscript, libintl, libiconv, and
sed packages from the gnuwin32 project (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/).
Detailed instructions are on their site, but here is the basic procedure.

1) Extract all packages to a folder on your hard drive, for example c:\gnuwin32

2) Add "c:\gnuwin32\bin" to the system "PATH" environment variable. If ViewVC
is running as part of a system service like IIS you will need to reboot the
computer so it is able to see the value. See the "Troubleshooting" section
below for specific information on when a reboot is neccessary.

BONSAI-LIKE CHECKIN DATABASE

To use the checkin database, you'll need to install MySQL and the MySQL-Python
interface. MySQL can be downloaded from www.mysql.com. The MySql-Python adapter
is available from http://sf.net/projects/mysql-python/. Make sure to grab the
the latest version from the "Files" section. (The "Home Page" link takes you to
an outdated page that only links to very old versions.) Both packages come with
GUI installers. Once you have MySQL running and set up with a username and
password, follow these instructions to set up ViewVC.

1) Open a command prompt and type these commands:

   cd /d <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>
   python bin\make-database

The script that comes up will prompt you for the MySQL username and password
(you should have created these during the MySQL installation), and the name of
the database to create. The default database name "ViewVC" should be fine
unless for some reason a database with that name already exists.

2) Enter the username, password, and database name into the [cvsdb] section of
the <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\viewvc.conf file.

3) At the command prompt run

   python bin\cvsdbadmin rebuild <repository>

where <repository> is the path to your CVS repository.

4) If you want the checkin database to be dynamically updated with every
checkin, add the following line to your CVSROOT/loginfo file:

   ALL python "<VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\bin\loginfo-handler" %{sVv}

If you decide not to enable dynamic updates, you can periodically refresh the
database with "python bin\cvsdbadmin update <repository>"

CVSGRAPH

To use CvsGraph with ViewVC, just put cvsgraph.exe in a directory on your
system PATH and set the use_cvsgraph option to 1 in your viewvc.conf file.

The CvsGraph home page is http://www.akhphd.au.dk/~bertho/cvsgraph/.

DOCROOT OPTIMIZATION

By default ViewVC serves up image and stylesheet files in
<VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\templates\docroot\ on its own instead of relying on the
webserver to deliver them. This simplifies web server configuration, but is
inefficient because it means the Python interpreter has to run each time one of
these files is downloaded. This causes ViewVC pages to load more slowly,
especially when ViewVC is running under CGI on Windows.

To make things more efficient, you can make the
<VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\templates\docroot directory available on your web server
and then set the "docroot" value in viewvc.conf to point to the web address of
the directory.

TROUBLESHOOTING

- By far the most common cause of errors in ViewVC is failure to successfully
  execute the programs it depends on (cvs, rlog, rcsdiff, co, enscript, sed,
  and cvsgraph). To help deal with this problem, ViewVC includes a special
  debugging mode that displays output from the programs it executes on every
  web page. This allows you to see error messages and other information that
  isn't normally visible. To enable the debugging mode, change line 23 of
  <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\lib\debug.py from:

    SHOW_CHILD_PROCESSES = 0

  to:

    SHOW_CHILD_PROCESSES = 1

  Important: You may need to restart your web server before this change takes
  effect. See "Changes made to..." later in this section.

- If you see the following error:

    error: (2, 'CreateProcess', The system cannot find the file specified.')

  it means that a program ViewVC has tried to execute could not be found by
  Windows. The fix to this is usually to install the program if it isn't
  already installed or to update the path to the program in viewvc.conf.
  Enabling the SHOW_CHILD_PROCESSES mode as described above can provide helpful
  diagnostic information such as the command line ViewVC is using to invoke the
  program and the value of the PATH environment variable in the environment
  ViewVC is running under.

- A common cause of server errors under IIS is permissions problems. You need
  to make sure that the virtual directory containing the CGI or ASP files has
  script execution enabled. You also need to make sure that the web server user
  accounts (IUSR_machine_name and IWAM_machine_name, where machine_name is your
  computer name) have read and execute access to the .asp or .cgi stub scripts,
  the ViewVC lib/ folder, the paths where external tools like cvs, rcs,
  enscript, sed, and cvsgraph live, and the CVS repositories. NTFS auditing
  makes it very easy to track down permissions problems. Also look for IIS
  messages in the event log.

- Certain Apache configurations may hide some environment variables from the
  ViewVC CGI scripts and the programs they launch. You can see whether an
  environment variable is visible from the CGI environment by enabling the
  SHOW_CHILD_PROCESSES debug mode described above. You can force Apache to let
  variables through with the PassEnv directive
  (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html#passenv).

- Changes made to environment variables, ViewVC source files and the ViewVC
  configuration file do not always take effect immediately. The table below
  shows what actions you need to take after changing any of these things before
  they will have an effect.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
  * If standalone.py was launched from a command prompt and you set the
  environment variable through the control panel, you'll need to open a new
  command prompt.

  Notes:

  Under ASP, changes made to the stub scripts inside the web root do take
  effect immediately, you only need to take additional action when you make
  changes to the main source files in <VIEWVC_INSTALL_DIR>\lib

  To "Unload ASP App", go to the IIS properties dialog for the application
  directory containing the ViewVC .asp files (in Internet Services Manager).
  Switch to the [Home] | [Virtual] Directory tab and click the "Unload" button
  under "Application Settings".

  To "reload(viewvc) in stub", put these lines in one of the ASP or Mod_Python
  stub scripts:

    import viewvc
    reload (viewvc)

  then load the page in a web browser.

- If you have problems getting ViewVC to work with mod_python, you can first
  make sure mod_python works standalone with the testing instructions at
  http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/inst-testing.html.

KNOWN ISSUES

- If you see ViewVC errors like

    Error parsing rlog output. Expected RCS file "c:\cvsroot\dir\file,v", found
    "c:\cvsroot\dir\RCS/file,v"

  it's because your RCS utilities don't recognize the RCS file suffix and are
  treating all files specified on the command line like working copies even
  when they end in ",v". You can fix this by including the following string in
  your RCSINIT environment variable:

    -x,v

  Important: You may need to reboot your computer before the environment
  variable has an effect. See "Changes made to..." in the TROUBLESHOOTING
  section.

- The GNU RCS utilities won't work with repository files that use CVSNT's
  unicode expansion mode (-ku). Files that use this mode will show up with an
  "rlog error: unknown expand mode u" error message in ViewVC directory
  listings. To work around this, you can set up ViewVC to use the CVSNT
  executable (cvs.exe) or CVSNT RCS tools (co.exe, rlog.exe, and rcsdiff.exe)
  instead of the GNU tools.

- The standalone server will not run under Cygwin Python because it does not
  support threads. ASP pages can't be run with Cygwin Python because it does
  not support ActiveX. To use either of these features you should install a
  native Python interpreter.

- On Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server under IIS, enscript might give an error
  like:

    enscript: couldn't open input filter "states -f
    "K:/gnuwin32/share/enscript/hl/enscript.st" -p
    "C://.enscript;K:/gnuwin32/share/enscript/hl" -shtml -Dcolor=1
    -Dstyle=emacs -Dlanguage=html -Dnum_input_files=1
    -Ddocument_title="Enscript Output" -Dtoc=0 -" for file "": No error
    no output generated

  The solution is to give read & execute permissions on cmd.exe to the
  IUSR_computername and IWAM_computername user accounts. (Enscript uses cmd.exe
  internally to launch its little helper program, states.exe).

- By default, ASP will set session cookies at each page load. ViewVC does not
  use these cookies and they can be safely disabled. You can do this by opening
  the IIS properties dialog for the application directory containing the ViewVC
  .asp files. Go to the [Home] | [Virtual] Directory tab and click the
  "Configuration" button under "Application Settings". On the dialog that comes
  up, uncheck "Enable Session State" under "App Options" -> "Application
  Configuration".

- Python support for ASP can be a little flaky. If you get strange errors, it
  can sometimes help to uninstall and reinstall it with pyscript.py. A number
  of people have also encountered a problem in ActivePython 2.2 where the first
  loads of any Python ASP page would work, but subsequent loads of the same
  page would always return nothing (leaving the screen blank). There were a
  number of workarounds for this problem, but the fix is to download and
  install the latest python win32 extensions from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

- ViewVC can't convert timestamps on diff pages to local time when it is used
  with CVSNT. This is caused by a CVSNT bug, which is described at
  http://www.cvsnt.org/mantis/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0000110

- Old versions of CVSNT (2.0.11 and earlier) have a bug in their rlog emulation
  which causes them to output truncated paths to RCS files. In ViewVC, this
  causes errors like

    Error parsing rlog output. Expected RCS file "c:\cvsroot\dir\file,v", found
    "file,v"

- Old versions of CVSNT (2.0.11 and earlier) have a bug in their standalone RCS
  tools (rlog.exe, co.exe, and rcsdiff.exe) which causes them not to properly
  interpret arguments with spaces. This can result in ViewVC errors in
  repositories that have spaces in file or directory names. This bug only
  occurs when ViewVC is configured to use the standalone utilities, not when it
  uses cvs.exe directly as it does by default.

- Old versions of CVSNT (1.11.1.3-76 and earlier) don't have any RCS emulation,
  so they can't be used as RCS parsers for ViewVC.

- Very old versions of CVSNT (1.11.1.3-57g and earlier) won't work reliably
  with our loginfo handler because they have a bug which makes them escape
  spaces and other special characters in filenames twice. This bug can result
  in loginfo errors or invalid data being inserted into the database.

- Old versions of Highlight (2.4.3 and earlier) will not show line numbers
  for .txt files or files of unknown type even when the
  "highlight_line_numbers" option is enabled.

- Highlight versions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 start line numbering for all file types
  at 0 instead of 1 by default. A workaround is to make ViewVC pass an
  explicit --line-number-start=1 option to Highlight

- Highlight version 2.4.4 starts line numbering for .txt files at 0 instead of
  1. It also misinterprets the --line-number-start option for those files,
  starting numbering one number before whatever number is specified. Since this
  behavior does not affect unknown file types, a simple workaround is just to
  not pass a --syntax option to Highlight for plain text files (instead of
  passing --syntax=txt).

Some script interpreters for IIS (like ASP and PHP) fail when they recieve requests like

  /script.asp/extra
  /script.php/fake/path
  
Aspfool is an ISAPI filter dll that intercepts requests with fake paths and maps them to valid local paths that the script interpreters should be able to handle more readily. The extended path information is still available to the actual scripts through the server variables, which are not altered.

Aspfool does not currently distinguish between scripts and other types of files. As a result, requests like

  /page.html/blah/blah
  /image.jpg/ha ha ha
 
will return actual files, instead of 404 not found errors.

Aspfool is known to compile with Visual C++ 6.0 and GCC 2.95 (mingw). Makefiles and project files are included.
